# Morse Code Learning Tool

This project is a web application designed to help users learn and practice Morse code. It provides an intuitive and interactive interface to translate text to Morse code and vice versa, as well as a practice mode to listen to Morse code audio and improve proficiency.

## Features

- **Text to Morse Code Translation**: Input text and get the corresponding Morse code.
- **Morse Code to Text Translation**: Input Morse code and get the text translation.
- **Practice Mode**: Users can listen to random Morse code and input the corresponding letter. The app tracks the user's score and progress.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Users can adjust the speed of the Morse code audio in practice mode using a slider.
- **Morse Code Audio**: Real Morse code tones are generated using the Web Audio API for an authentic learning experience.
- **Rehear Button**: Re-listen to the current Morse code in practice mode.
- **Hide/Show Answers**: Toggle the visibility of the correct answer while practicing to challenge yourself.
- **Morse Code Table with Audio**: A table that displays the entire Morse code alphabet, with a button next to each letter to play its Morse code audio.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web app.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout of the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Functionality, including translation, practice mode, and audio playback.
- **Web Audio API**: Used for generating the Morse code tones.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## How to Use

1. **Translation**: Enter text in the input box and click "Translate" to see the Morse code equivalent. Similarly, you can input Morse code to translate it back to text.
2. **Practice Mode**: Click "Start Practice" to begin a session where you hear a Morse code letter. Type your guess, submit it, and check your progress.
3. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to increase or decrease the speed of the Morse code playback during practice mode.
4. **Morse Code Table**: Play individual Morse code letters from the table by clicking the play button next to each character.
